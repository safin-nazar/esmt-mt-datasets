The average knowledge worker employed on a back office process has a lot of repetitive, routine tasks that are dreary and uninteresting. RPA is a type of software that mimics the activity of a human being in carrying out a task within a process. It can do repetitive stuff more quickly, accurately, and tirelessly than humans, freeing them to do other tasks requiring human strengths such as emotional intelligence, reasoning, judgment, and interaction with the customer.Kantu is not only one tool but a growing family of image-driven web, desktop and mobile automation tools. We already released Kantu for Web Automation. The launch of Kantu for Desktop Automation is scheduled for December 2017, and Kantu for Mobile Automation in 2018.What is unique about our solution?Most “other” automation tools work on some very technically level and require the user to fiddle with so-called class names, process IDs, document-object model (DOM) and other obscure parameters to create a successful automation script. But even if you have these skills, wouldn’t you rather use them and your time to be creative and work with customers, and not debugging and testing the automation scripts themselves?Kantu’s image-driven automation works on the visual website and desktop, just like a human does.

Under Ficosa’s control, ADASENS will play a decisive role in key technology for the research and development of new image recognition-technology that will lead to a safer and more autonomous driving environment.",—,—,—,M&A,—,

The core of our technology is the evolutionary development of Artificial Intelligence in combination with state-of-the-art deep learning methods. It follows a selection process (crossing-over, mutation, and selection) as known from nature. The result is neural networks that are automatically designed and optimized using our scalable learning technology.These models provide a higher prediction accuracy, because the inputs, network structure and neuron weighting were optimized for the data and the purpose of the business case. This ensures that the swarm of artificial intelligence is perfectly matched to the data volume and represents the best compromise between overfitting and underfitting. This optimization is fully automated!

With time, this will only get easier and videos like these can spread like wildfire on social media, just like fake news in 2016, but now on steroids, in the form of fake videos.

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle, using real-time data to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning. In terms of automated production and level of digitalization, the construction industry is still significantly behind other industries. Nevertheless, the megatrends like Big Data or the Internet of Things offer great opportunities for the future development of the construction sector. Prerequisite for the successful Construction 4.0 is the creation of a digital twin of a construction site. CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling) enables architects and planners to come together and work on a set of 3D models. This in return, creates an interactive project which promotes real-time collaboration. When the architects and engineers are collaborating, planning and sharing the information of the project, they are effectively employing CIM. Through the use of CIM, projects of any scale are able to be constructed, this could be something as small as an individual building to a full-fledged town. CIM’s ability to offer improved results at a lower cost is what drives the change from traditional methods in the industry. Along the total life cycle from design to construction, operation and maintenance towards remodeling or demolition, the digital twin follows all modifications of the real construction site and dynamically readjusts itself in case of recorded performance differences. Thus, for the whole lifespan of the real construction site, performance predictions generated with the virtual twin represent an accurate basis for well-informed decisions.DigitalTwin Technology is a construction technology company operating out of Cologne Germany. DigitalTwin Technology is the first company in the world to make use of VR and AR for digital twin in the tunneling segment of the construction industry for CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling). Tunnelware is a VaaS (Virtuality as a Service) for tunnel construction industry to manage the construction process while managing the data generated by various sensors and human interaction.

Genome data is used, for example, to study the effects of drug candidates in animal experiments in the pharmaceutical industry. Genome mapping is crucial for breeding new varieties in the seed industry, and in biotechnology for developing yeasts with new properties. Every day, thousands of genomes are sequenced worldwide. However, most of this data is difficult to find and usually only one aspect of the data is analysed. Analysing genome data means assigning a function to each individual letter in the genome. The difficulty is that genomes are up to 30 billion letters long but consist of only 4 different letters. And only about 1% of the letters in the genome contain important information like genes. Based on 20 years of genome research, we have developed a new, proprietary software, which we use in combination with a database of all the world's sequenced creatures to perform genome analyses with unprecedented quality and speed.

The focus of our work is on developing conversational interfaces based on artificial intelligence that enable companies to automate customer communication.The Chatbot Solution called moinAI is a SaaS-Product developed by knowhere. moinAI is a self-learning AI chatbot solution for digital customer communication of companies. No matter if marketing, sales or customer service - moinAI is the automation solution that helps to react quickly and efficiently to customer requests around the clock. Depending on the use case, this results in benefits such as increased customer satisfaction, more automated leads, an increased conversion rate and a reduction in support volume.  Numerous companies from various industries have already optimized their customer communication with moinAI. These include Geberit, Velux, Abus, Der Spiegel and Dräger. The bandwidth of use cases ranges from first level support to marketing campaigns up to e-commerce strategies and many more. However, one thing is true for each of the above-mentioned use cases: the impressive KPIs resulting from automation.  What makes moinAI so special is its ability to learn on its own. The so-called self-learning works by means of several AI-principles and ensures that moinAI is a self-runner in the truest sense of the word. Once the AI chatbot has been trained by us and implemented at the respective company, no further and costly training sessions on the part of the company are required. In addition, the language understanding is Natural-Language-Processing-based (NLP-based), which means that the AI does not understand user queries on the basis of keywords, but instead identifies semantic relationships, which makes it possible to understand long and complicated sentences. Through NLP and AI, moinAI therefore understands even complex messages and learns independently with each user conversation. Thus moinAI offers a system that grows with the needs and requirements of the company.",—,"Sep 1, 2015",1,—,Non-equity Assistance,

Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity. Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria.Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data.This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously.

Trees capture CO2 from our atmosphere and store it as carbon while releasing the oxygen we breathe. Through the TREEO technology, we empower tree growers in the Global South and finance reforestation and restoration projects. We then guarantee the carbon is stored in the long term with harvested wood products and biochar. TREEO guarantees full transparency through our single-tree monitoring technology.Solving the climate crisis requires scalable and inclusive carbon removal solutions. For millions of smallholder farmers, climate finance is currently inaccessible. To monetize their carbon removals, they need reliable and easy-to-use monitoring technologies, required for transparency and trust. It is our mission to provide farmers with exactly that: A single-tree monitoring technology, empowering local communities to generate verified carbon removals and connecting them to the global carbon market. With these partnerships and the TREEO Technology, we can then provide companies transparent CDRs to live up to their corporate responsibility with the data to prove their impact.",—,—,—,—,—,

After starting off with the advances of platooning, our team now leverages the power of artificial intelligence and big data to help the industry reduce their environmental footprint and increase efficiency. Thereby we are getting closer to our vision of a future powered by sustainable freight transport.We use artificial intelligence to analyze fleet performance to provide fleet owners of any size with real-time performance analytics to empower road freight companies to increase fuel efficiency to reduce their energy consumption and ecological footprint. This includes advanced performance analysis of single vehicles, transparent efficiency comparison between vehicles and recommendations tools with actionable insights to increase efficiency of their fleets and help them make better decisions , all in a single-view dashboard. This significantly improves the customers’ bottom line and strengthens their competitive advantage in the market.Furthermore, Tracks enables effective CO2 emissions management to increase transparency and sustainability for shippers.

With his many years of experience as a software engineer and in-depth knowledge of mobile and cloud development, software engineering, databases, blockchain and IT project management, he has an overview of the big picture and always keeps the company and our products at the forefront of current technologies.As COO, Thorsten Bruges is our creative and communicative mind.

With his experience in machine learning, he is also responsible for the automation of ThreeNamic's processes. Through his experience in industry and in sales, Thorsten has an important perspective on the necessary functionality of our products and advises our customers on all aspects of our products, projects and the company.There are a number of software solutions on the market that support entrepreneurs in capturing the data necessary for their everyday work and making adjustments. Most offers here have in common that the user has to submit to the procedures prescribed by the program or that the software only displays a snapshot.Our vision is software that can be adapted to the needs of the user and that also accompanies and documents the entire process. We would also like to create the possibility of accessing the processes from anywhere in order to enable modern and location-independent work. Today this is only possible if an entrepreneur can raise the necessary capital to have customized software programmed. With ThreeNamic, we want to give every entrepreneur - regardless of type and size - the opportunity to adapt a software solution to their needs. Our customers should concentrate on their core competencies and know that our software is the perfect digital partner by their side.In many conversations we have heard that digital developments in many companies are still in their infancy and that those responsible are facing major challenges. Most companies already have processes that have proven themselves over long periods of time. The introduction of new software is then not only the transfer of data into a new system, but in most cases also an adaptation of current processes to the processes specified by the new system.We want to be the solution here. Our goal is to enable every company to become more efficient with the help of digitization. We enable the smallest start-up to the largest company to digitize all corporate processes on a global scale and thus work more effectively, transparently and securely.Starting with training for customers and employees, the planning and organization of events or meetings, through the digitization of training and further education to the complete automation of critical company processes, with ThreeNamic we have the appropriate solution.","50,000.00 €","Feb 13, 2019",—,Seed,Seed,

While sensors placed throughout the power plant generated extremely complex datasets, it proved impossible to close the performance loop and analyze them efficiently. Researchers solved this problem by developing of a pure software solution that reduces the dataset's footprint without losing any of its granularity or complexity. Recognizing the universal value of the solution, Siemens AG, established Panoratio as a separate, independent entity. Since then, Panoratio has developed PANOsight, a software suite underpinned by the patented compression technology, and has over 50 customers in production.

Breweries and wineries of all sizes around the world have now chosen to replace the time-consuming and human error - prone standard method (yeast cell count using haemocytometer) with Oculyze, a far more reliable, fast, and cost-saving solution for monitoring fermentation during all the stages of the production process. While working on constantly improving its flagship products, Oculyze also focuses on bringing the advantages of cloud-based image recognition, like faster development time, lower cost and better image recognition to other applications such as ethanol and bioethanol (or ethanol fuel) production, blood or sperm counts, parasite detection in feces, asbestos fiber detection, emulsion analysis, and bacteria detection, thereby continuing to add applications to its cloud-based image recognition platform.  Oculyze can offer turnkey solutions to businesses, integrating three essential components – the image analysis platform (for data storage & backup, user authentication, and task handling), a custom image analysis & recognition software and the image capture software developed by Oculyze.

Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity. Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria.Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data.This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously.

No matter if marketing, sales or customer service - moinAI is the automation solution that helps to react quickly and efficiently to customer requests around the clock. Depending on the use case, this results in benefits such as increased customer satisfaction, more automated leads, an increased conversion rate and a reduction in support volume.  Numerous companies from various industries have already optimized their customer communication with moinAI. These include Geberit, Velux, Abus, Der Spiegel and Dräger. The bandwidth of use cases ranges from first level support to marketing campaigns up to e-commerce strategies and many more. However, one thing is true for each of the above-mentioned use cases: the impressive KPIs resulting from automation.  What makes moinAI so special is its ability to learn on its own. The so-called self-learning works by means of several AI-principles and ensures that moinAI is a self-runner in the truest sense of the word. Once the AI chatbot has been trained by us and implemented at the respective company, no further and costly training sessions on the part of the company are required. In addition, the language understanding is Natural-Language-Processing-based (NLP-based), which means that the AI does not understand user queries on the basis of keywords, but instead identifies semantic relationships, which makes it possible to understand long and complicated sentences. Through NLP and AI, moinAI therefore understands even complex messages and learns independently with each user conversation.

Genome data is used, for example, to study the effects of drug candidates in animal experiments in the pharmaceutical industry. Genome mapping is crucial for breeding new varieties in the seed industry, and in biotechnology for developing yeasts with new properties. Every day, thousands of genomes are sequenced worldwide. However, most of this data is difficult to find and usually only one aspect of the data is analysed. Analysing genome data means assigning a function to each individual letter in the genome. The difficulty is that genomes are up to 30 billion letters long but consist of only 4 different letters. And only about 1% of the letters in the genome contain important information like genes. Based on 20 years of genome research, we have developed a new, proprietary software, which we use in combination with a database of all the world's sequenced creatures to perform genome analyses with unprecedented quality and speed. Customers can have their own genomes analysed in service or use mendle, a Google-like search, to search our database for information that interests them.",—,—,—,—,—,
